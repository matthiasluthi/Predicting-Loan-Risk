# Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting loan risk using data from LendingClub, a U.S.-based peer-to-peer lending platform. The goal is to identify loans that are likely to be defaulted or paid back with delay, providing valuable insights for future loan approval decisions.

**Overview**
The project follows a structured and well-documented approach to handle real-world, large-scale, and imbalanced data:
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection and engineering
- Preprocessing
- Addressing class imbalance
- Prevention of data leakage

**Modeling**
- Training of multiple algorithms: elastic-net regression, support-vector machines, gradient boosting trees (XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- K-fold cross-validation
- Evaluation
- Performance comparison across models using the confusion matrix
- Final model selection and interpretation
